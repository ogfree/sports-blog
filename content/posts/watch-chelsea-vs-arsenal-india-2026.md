# Where to Watch Chelsea vs Arsenal F.C. in India (2026): Live Stream & TV Guide

The London derby between Chelsea and Arsenal is one of the most intense rivalries in English football. As we look ahead to the 2026 fixtures, Indian football fans are eager to know how to catch every tackle, goal, and dramatic moment live.

While the exact schedule for the 2026/27 season is still on the horizon, broadcasting rights often remain consistent year-to-year. Here is your comprehensive guide on where to watch Chelsea vs. Arsenal in India for the 2026 season, including live streaming and TV options.

## The Home of Football in India: Star Sports

For years, Star Sports has been the premier destination for live football broadcasting in India. Following the Disney-Star merger and the acquisition of major sports rights, it is highly expected that Star Sports will retain the broadcasting rights for the English Premier League (EPL) in India for the 2026 season.

### How to Watch on TV
If you prefer the traditional viewing experience, you will likely find the match on:
*   **Star Sports Select 1 / HD:** This is the primary channel for English Premier League matches in India.
*   **Star Sports Select 2 / HD:** Occasionally used for simultaneous matches or pre/post-match analysis.

**Action Step:** Keep your cable/DTH subscription active and check the EPG (Electronic Programme Guide) for the specific fixture date in 2026.

## Live Streaming on Disney+ Hotstar

In the digital age, mobile streaming is king. Disney+ Hotstar has been the go-to platform for EPL streaming in India, offering high-definition streams with interactive features.

### How to Stream on Mobile and Web
For the 2026 Chelsea vs. Arsenal clash, you can likely stream the match via:
*   **Disney+ Hotstar App:** Available on Android and iOS.
*   **Web Browser:** Accessible via desktop or laptop at [hotstar.com](https://www.hotstar.com).

**Subscription Note:** Historically, Disney+ Hotstar has offered premium subscriptions for ad-free viewing and HD streaming. Ensure you have an active plan (Super or Premium) to enjoy the match without interruptions.

## Potential Alternatives: OTT Aggregators

The landscape of digital rights is always shifting. By 2026, there is a possibility of streaming rights being distributed or accessed via aggregated platforms.

*   **JioTV / Airtel Xstream:** If Star Sports holds the linear rights, these aggregator apps often allow users to watch live TV channels (like Star Sports) via their mobile networks if they have a valid recharge or subscription. This is a great backup option if you are on the go.

## Match Timing for Indian Viewers

Derbies rarely happen at convenient times, but the excitement compensates for the late nights. EPL matches in the UK usually take place in the afternoon or evening (GMT).

*   **Standard Kick-off Time:** Most EPL matches kick off at **1:30 AM IST** (Indian Standard Time) on Sundays.
*   **Prime Time Matches:** Occasionally, matches are scheduled for **7:30 PM IST** or **10:30 PM IST** on Saturdays.

**Pro Tip:** For the 2026 season, keep an eye on the official Premier League schedule released in mid-2026 to confirm the exact IST for the Chelsea vs. Arsenal fixture.

## Why You Shouldn't Miss This Derby

The Chelsea vs. Arsenal rivalry is steeped in history. From the "Battle of the Bridge" to the tactical masterclasses of recent years, this fixture never disappoints. In 2026, we expect to see a new generation of stars battling for London bragging rights. Whether it’s a title decider or a fight for the top four, the atmosphere is electric.

## Conclusion

To watch Chelsea vs. Arsenal F.C. in India in 2026, your best bets are **Star Sports** on TV and **Disney+ Hotstar** for live streaming. While the digital landscape may evolve, these platforms have historically been the custodians of Premier League football in the region.
